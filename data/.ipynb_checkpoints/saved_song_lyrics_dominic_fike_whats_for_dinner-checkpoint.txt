[Chorus]
Two million miles a minute, babe, huh
Headed for certain destruction
Jot down your dying wishes, hey
All of your dying wishes

[Verse 1]
Breathe
Baby, don't defy our needs
Simple things make a difference in your day
Take the time to tell me why, what is it anyway?
My apologies, I'm so sorry
I just got back from the gastroenterologist
He told me that I can't drink, so now I be high and shit
And all insensitive
And then when you cry, I get fuckin' anxiety
Breathe, darlin', don't defy our needs
Simple things make a difference in your day
Take the time to tell me how it ended up this way

[Chorus]
Two million miles a minute, babe, huh
Headed for certain destruction
Jot down your dying wishes, hey
All of your dying wishes

[Verse 2]
Your love is cheap
Babe, it don't cost anything
If you stay, is it mine to give away?
Just who is it that decides
What happens when you can't keep doin' it?
It makes you wonder, if I was careful
Would it be something worth repair or
Or am I just scared for ya?
