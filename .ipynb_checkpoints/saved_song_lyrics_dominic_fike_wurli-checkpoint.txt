[Chorus]
Steppin' outside for you (Woah)
Then I put links on both wrists (Woah)
'Cause you got control over me
And you got jokes like you don't need love, baby
We don't need long (Woah)
Can you follow my lead for once? (Woah)
I can never make up for the time
I can make the way down worth the ride

[Verse]
Not like this, I'm not goin' out
This is not love, I'm a glorified doorstop
Stickin' my foot out for you
And that's not all I would do
Girl, you got me by my hands here
(Well, bae, you got me, bae, you got me, bae)
I'm steppin' out with shackles on my ankles
(Well, bae, you got me, bae, you got me, bae)
You wonder why we fell into a standstill
I said it never bothered me, but
Not like this, I'm not goin' out
This is not love, I'm a glorified doorstop
Stickin' my foot out for you
And that's not all I would do
Not like this, I'm not goin' out
This is not done, this is sort of like love
When I'm stickin' my foot out for you
But it's not all I would do

[Chorus]
Steppin' outside for you (Woah)
Then I put links on both wrists (Woah)
'Cause you got control over me
And you got jokes like you don't need love, baby
We don't need long (Woah)
Can you follow my lead for once? (Woah)
I can never make up for the time
I can make the way down worth the ride

[Outro]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
