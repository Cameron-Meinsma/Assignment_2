Baby, come here
I get so lonely at night

I had to tell her that I'm desperate
Doesn't it show in my smile?
Oh, I had to tell her that I'm bad for ya
It doesn't show in your eyes

(Oh, cool)
Oh, you're so cool
And I wish I was you
So why can't you tell me
What you think I should do?

So why can't you tell me
What you think I should do

Baby, come here
I get so lonely at night
