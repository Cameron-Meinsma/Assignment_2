    "I scraped all the lyrics from the songs on the 'What Could Possibly Go Wrong' (2020) album by Dominic Fike, using the Genius API. Moreover, I turned the lyrics into TXT files and I put those files in the data directory. Furthermore, because the naming convention of the files is as follows: 'saved_song_lyrics_dominic_fike_song_title.txt', I changed them to only include the song title."
