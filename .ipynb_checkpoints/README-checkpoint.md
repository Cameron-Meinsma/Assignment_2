### Corpus
The corpus consists of TXT files of the lyrics of every song on the 'What Could Possibly Go Wrong' (2020) album by Dominic Fike.

### Target audience and Intended Use of the Corpus
The target audience are individuals who want to examine the lyrics of the songs on that album in some way. The intended use of the corpus is to have all the lyrics in one place, so one has a clear overview of all the songs, which should make it easier to quickly investigate the way that the songs are structured as well as the specific words that are being used.
