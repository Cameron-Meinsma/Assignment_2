[Chorus]
Baby, come here
I get so lonely at night

[Verse]
Why can't you tell that I'm desperate?
Doesn't it show in my smile?
Why can't you tell that I'm bad for ya?
It doesn't show in your eyes
(Oh, cool) Oh, you're so cool
I wish I was you
So why can't you tell me
What you think I should do?
[Bridge]
So why can't you tell me
What you think I should do?

[Chorus]
Baby, come here
I get so lonely at night
